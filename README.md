## Introduction

This repo contains a GitHub Action that determines the affected [Atmos](https://atmos.tools) stacks for a PR, then
creates a comment on the PR which Spacelift can use to trigger the corresponding stacks via a push policy.

Optionally, you can use the `spacectl` trigger method, which uses the `spacectl` CLI to trigger the corresponding
spacelift stacks directly rather than via comment/push policy.



## Usage



```yaml
  name: Pull Request
  on:
    pull_request:
      branches: [ 'main' ]
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

  jobs:
    context:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Atmos Affected Stacks Trigger Spacelift (via comment)
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-trigger-spacelift@main
          id: example
          with:
            atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos
            github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

        - name: Atmos Affected Stacks Trigger Spacelift (direct)
          uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-affected-trigger-spacelift@main
          id: example
          with:
            atmos-config-path: ./rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos
            github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
            trigger-method: spacectl
            spacelift-endpoint: https://unicorn.app.spacelift.io
            spacelift-api-key-id: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID }}
            spacelift-api-key-secret: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET }}
